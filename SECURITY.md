# Atrax Security Considerations

## Architecture Security

Atrax operates with a security-focused architecture:

1. **Secure Interface Exposure**:
   - Atrax connects to MCP servers via stdio (process-based servers)
   - Atrax ONLY exposes proxy functionality via HTTP, never directly via stdio
   - This prevents direct access to the underlying MCP servers

2. **Server Isolation**:
   - Each underlying MCP server runs in its own process space
   - Servers cannot directly communicate with each other
   - Resource conflicts are handled safely within Atrax

3. **Capability Handling**:
   - Atrax detects server capabilities dynamically
   - Prevents calls to unsupported methods
   - Graceful handling of missing capabilities

## Security Best Practices

1. **Never expose the MCP server directly**:
   - Always use the HTTP interface provided by the `serve` command
   - Never use the `connectStdio()` method in production

2. **Configure with Appropriate Permissions**:
   - Run servers with minimal required permissions
   - For example, filesystem MCP servers should only have access to specific directories

3. **Validate Client Requests**:
   - All requests through Atrax are validated before being forwarded
   - Request validation prevents security vulnerabilities like path traversal

## Secure Deployment Guidelines

1. **Run Behind a Reverse Proxy**:
   - Use NGINX, Apache, or a cloud load balancer
   - Configure TLS/SSL for secure communication
   - Implement proper authentication if required

2. **Use Docker Containers**:
   - Each MCP server should run in its own container
   - Limit container privileges based on server needs
   - Use volume mounts to restrict file access

3. **Monitor and Log**:
   - Enable detailed logging for security analysis
   - Monitor for unusual access patterns
   - Regularly review logs for security issues

## Reporting Security Issues

If you discover a security vulnerability in Atrax, please report it responsibly by:

1. **DO NOT** disclose the issue publicly
2. Submit details to [security@example.com]
3. Allow time for the issue to be addressed before disclosure

## Security Updates

Atrax is regularly updated to address security concerns. Make sure to:

1. Keep Atrax updated to the latest version
2. Subscribe to security announcements
3. Regularly update all dependencies
