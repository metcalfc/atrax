# Comprehensive Testing Guide for Atrax Type Improvements

This guide outlines the test strategy for validating the type improvements made in Steps 1-8 of our plan to replace `any` with proper TypeScript types.

## Test Coverage Overview

We've created a comprehensive set of tests in these categories:

1. **Type Definition Tests** - Validate our custom type definitions
2. **McpProxy Tests** - Test the improved method determination with generics
3. **ServerRegistry Tests** - Validate improved pendingResponses Map and sendMessage with generics
4. **Transport Tests** - Test the typed event handlers in transport implementations
5. **Auth Config Tests** - Verify the discriminated union approach for auth types
6. **Integration Tests** - End-to-end message flow with proper types

## Running the Tests

To run all tests:

```bash
npm test
```

To run specific test categories:

```bash
# Run only unit tests
npm test -- --testPathPattern=tests/unit

# Run only a specific test file
npm test -- --testPathPattern=tests/unit/mcp-types.test.ts
```

## Test Files

### Unit Tests

1. **Type Definition Tests** - `tests/unit/mcp-types.test.ts`
   - Tests for JSONRPCErrorObject, MethodParams, MethodResults, and McpCapabilities
   - Validates type mapping for MCP methods
   - Tests compile-time type assertions

2. **McpProxy Tests** - `tests/unit/mcp-proxy.test.ts`
   - Tests for type-safe method determination
   - Tests for direct message handling
   - Tests client transport management with typed events

3. **ServerRegistry Tests** - `tests/unit/server-registry.test.ts`
   - Tests improved pendingResponses Map with proper types
   - Tests sendMessage with generic type support
   - Validates end-to-end message flow with typed responses

4. **Transport Tests** - `tests/unit/transport.test.ts`
   - Tests typed event handlers for all transport implementations
   - Validates message handling with proper types
   - Tests error handling with typed errors

5. **Auth Config Tests** - `tests/unit/auth-config.test.ts`
   - Tests discriminated union approach for auth types
   - Validates type guards for runtime type checking
   - Tests compile-time type safety for auth configurations

### Integration Tests

1. **MCP Types Integration Tests** - `tests/integration/mcp-types-integration.test.ts`
   - End-to-end testing of message flow through the entire system
   - Validates proper typing at each stage of message handling
   - Tests error handling with proper types

## What to Look For

When running the tests, look for the following:

1. **Compile-Time Type Errors**: The TypeScript compiler should catch any type mismatches
2. **Runtime Type Validation**: Type guards should properly validate at runtime
3. **Type Inference**: Generic types should properly infer return types
4. **Error Handling**: Errors should be properly typed and handled
5. **Edge Cases**: The tests cover various edge cases, including:
   - Missing fields in messages
   - Invalid configuration options
   - Server disconnection during pending requests
   - Timeout handling
   - Error propagation

## Additional Validations

After running the tests, these manual checks should be performed:

1. **Build Validation**: Ensure the project builds without errors
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

2. **Smoke Tests**: Run the smoke tests to ensure end-to-end functionality
   ```bash
   cd tests/smoke
   ./test-atrax.sh
   ```

3. **Inspector Tool Testing**: Use the MCP Inspector tool to verify protocol compliance
   (This will be covered in Step 10 of our plan)

## Reporting Issues

If you find any issues during testing, please document them with:

1. The specific test that failed
2. The expected vs. actual behavior
3. Any relevant error messages
4. The file and line number where the issue occurs

## Next Steps

After completing Step 9 (Comprehensive Testing), we will move to Step 10 (MCP Inspector Tool Testing) to verify protocol compliance using the official MCP Inspector tool.
